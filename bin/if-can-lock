    USAGE:
        if-can-lock LOCKFILE [--contents=string] COMMAND [ARGS ...]

        Tries to acquire an exclusive lock on LOCKFILE.  Exits nonzero
        immediately if LOCKFILE does not exist.  Exits 0 immediately if it is
        unable to acquire the lock.  Otherwise, execs COMMAND with ARGS (the
        lock will continue to be held after the exec).  When COMMAND exits,
        the lock will automatically be released.
